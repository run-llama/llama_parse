Additionally, low recall can occur when not all relevant chunks are retrieved, resulting in a lack of sufficient context for the language model to synthesize an answer. Outdated information in the retrieved data can also pose a challenge. On the response generation side, challenges include hallucination where the model generates an answer not present in the context, irrelevance where the answer does not address the question, and toxicity/bias where the answer is harmful or offensive.\n"
