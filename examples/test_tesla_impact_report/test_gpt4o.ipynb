      "The very purpose of Tesla’s existence is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. In furtherance of this mission, we are excited to publish our second annual Impact Report. Transparency and disclosure are important for our customers, employees, and shareholders, which is why we have expanded the Impact Report’s content this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "While many environmental reports focus on emissions generated by the manufacturing phase of products and future goals for energy consumption, we highlight the totality of the environmental impact of our products today. After all, the vast majority of emissions generated by vehicles today occur in the product-use phase—that is, when consumers are driving their vehicles. We believe that providing information on both sides of the manufacturing and consumer-use equation provides a clearer picture of the environmental impact of Tesla products, and we have done so this year largely through a lifecycle analysis detailed in this report.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla aims to continue to increase the proportion of renewable energy usage at our factories in an effort to minimize the carbon footprint for every mile traveled by our products and their components in our supply chain. All of the factories that we built from the ground-up, such as Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai, and our forthcoming Gigafactories in Berlin and North America, are designed from the beginning to use energy from renewable sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making a significant and lasting impact on environmental sustainability is difficult to achieve without securing financial sustainability for the long term. We generated positive Free Cash Flow (operating cash flow less capex) of more than $1 billion for the first time in 2019. We believe the notion that a sustainable future is not economically feasible is no longer valid.\n",
      "---\n",
      "# Mission & Tesla Ecosystem\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate change is reaching alarming levels in large part due to emissions from burning fossil fuels for transportation and electricity generation. In 2016, carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration levels in the atmosphere exceeded the 400 parts per million threshold on a sustained basis - a level that climate scientists believe will have a catastrophic impact on the environment. Worse, annual global CO2 emissions continue to increase and have approximately doubled over the past 50 years to over 43 gigatons in 2019. The world’s current path is unwise and unsustainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world cannot reduce CO2 emissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption. And the world cannot address its energy habits without first directly reducing emissions in the transportation and energy sectors. We are focused on creating a complete energy and transportation ecosystem from solar generation and energy storage to all-electric vehicles that produce zero tailpipe emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the onset of shelter-in-place orders and travel restrictions due to COVID-19, we have seen dramatic increases in air quality across the planet, as well as projections for CO2 emissions to drop in excess of 4% in 2020 compared to pre-COVID-19 levels, according to researchers. Because these improvements in air quality and reductions in CO2 are a result of a global economic disruption and not due to systemic changes in how we produce and consume energy, they are not expected to be sustained absent intervention. However, these changes have shown us the positive impacts of reduced pollution in a very short period of time. At Tesla, we believe that we all have an unprecedented opportunity to learn from this disruption and accelerate the deployment of clean energy solutions as part of a recovery for all economies throughout the world, and we will actively continue to advocate for the realization of these long-term changes.\n",

      "To create an entire sustainable energy ecosystem, Tesla also manufactures a unique set of energy products that enable homeowners, businesses and utilities to produce and manage renewable energy generation, storage and consumption. Homeowners can install solar panels or Solar Roof to power their home using 100% renewable energy and then store that energy in Powerwall, which makes electricity available during peak energy-use periods and at night, while also providing power during grid outages. Meanwhile, depending on their particular requirements and the size of the project, utilities and businesses can purchase Megapack – an infinitely scalable energy storage system that provides greater control, efficiency, and reliability across the electric grid – for their energy storage needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Renewable energy generation and storage are critical components of developing microgrids — an increasingly important means of delivering reliable and sustainable electricity around the world. As the deployment of Tesla’s products continues to accelerate, we can scale the adoption of renewable energy, cost-effectively modernize our aging infrastructure (while becoming less reliant on it), and improve the resilience of the electric grid to benefit everyone.\n",

      "In this section of the Impact Report, we will go through the details and calculations of the lifetime environmental impact of our products.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are often asked if electric vehicles (EVs) are more sustainable than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. The environmental impact of zero-emission transport and energy products, like the products that Tesla produces and sells, is undeniably more positive than the GHG-emitting alternatives. However, determining the lifetime impact of EVs versus ICE vehicles requires looking at the entire lifecycle - from raw materials to emissions to disposal and not just at the emissions resulting from vehicle usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not a straightforward task and some of the most common omissions that we have seen in similar studies include the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "a) Using Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fuel/energy consumption data (which overestimate fuel-economy and underestimate emissions), rather than real-world data;\n",
      "\n",
      "b) Not taking into account the higher energy efficiency of Tesla’s powertrains;\n",
      "\n",
      "c) Assuming that the average EV needs a battery replacement at some point in its life;\n",
      "\n",
      "d) Not accounting for emissions generated through oil refining and the transportation process; and\n",
      "\n",
      "e) Using outdated data for the carbon impact of cell manufacturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "We tried to address these considerations and complexities in deriving a more accurate calculation in the following lifecycle analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to remember that environmental impact goes beyond just carbon footprint. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than four million people die of air pollution every year. The reduction of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and other particulates in the air makes our communities healthier places to live, work, and visit and is another core benefit of driving an EV.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, solar panels deployed by Tesla (including SolarCity prior to its 2016 acquisition by Tesla) over the years have generated vastly more electricity than what was required to run our factories and related facilities.\n",

      "\n",
      "On the right and in the following pages we have laid out our lifecycle analysis, which includes the emissions per mile from:\n",
      "\n",
      "- A current Fremont-made Model 3 charged from a grid with the generation mix that reflects the geographic distribution of Model 3 deliveries in the U.S.\n",
      "- What emissions per mile could be if the Model 3 were used for ridesharing over one million miles using cell chemistry from our energy products.\n",
      "- What emissions per mile could be if a Model 3 were principally charged at home using a solar system and energy storage.\n",
      "- What emissions per mile could be if a Model 3 were used for ridesharing over one million miles using cell chemistry from our energy products and if it were only charged using a solar system and energy storage.\n",
      "- The reference ICE vehicle is based on the average mid-size premium sedan in the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important variable in a life cycle analysis is real-world fuel consumption or electricity consumption, which impacts the use phase of the lifecycle. Various efficiency testing cycles such as the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), WLTP, or EPA don’t truly represent real-world fuel/energy consumption. This is why, for the purpose of this analysis, we used average energy consumption over the more than 4 billion miles Tesla Model 3s have travelled to date, including energy losses during the charging process. For ICE vehicles, we used real-world fuel consumption data provided by Consumer Reports, according to which mid-size premium sedans for model year 2019 on average achieve 23.6 MPG, and this translates to approximately 420 grams of CO2 per mile, once we account for emissions generated through extraction, refining, and shipment of oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if we use the official EPA efficiency rating (instead of real-world data) for a Toyota Prius of 56 MPG, which translates to 177 grams of CO2 per mile (incl. refining & transport of oil), an EV would still emit fewer lifetime emissions than the Prius. Regarding mileage and lifespan, we estimate that an average vehicle in the U.S. is driven slightly less than 12,000 miles per year for about 17 years before it is scrapped. Furthermore, as an ICE vehicle ages, its fuel efficiency only remains stable if serviced properly. On the other hand, electricity generation to charge EVs has become “greener” over time with the addition of cleaner energy sources to the grid. Thus, emissions generated through EV charging should continue to decline over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to highlight that, for the purpose of this analysis, we assumed no additional renewable energy capacity on the grid during the life of the vehicle given the shape of the renewable energy adoption curve in the U.S. is still very much up for debate. That said, in the following slide we show that a Tesla Model 3 charged in locations with “greener” grids like New York state, for example, have much lower lifecycle emissions than the U.S. average. We believe that cities, states, and countries alike will strive to reduce grid emissions in the future. This dynamic highlights how EVs on the road today will become cleaner as they age and how critical “greening” the grid will be to achieving reduced transportation emissions.\n",

      "While the electricity grid varies from region to region, charging EVs is becoming less carbon intensive every year. In the U.S., coal has historically been the dominant energy source for generating electricity. But in the last decade, coal power has declined significantly as regions turn to cleaner energy sources. Energy generated by renewable sources has grown rapidly, accounting for an estimated 43% of new electricity generation capacity in 2018. Many U.S. states (such as New York referenced in the chart below) have been making significant investments in renewable energy as these sustainable options become more cost competitive compared to fossil fuel resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "To put this in perspective, average GHG emissions from charging one New York-based Tesla vehicle equates to the emissions from an ICE vehicle with a fuel economy of 144 MPG (no such vehicle is on the market). Even when charging a Tesla in Michigan, where approximately 64% of energy comes from coal and natural gas, the emissions from our vehicles still equates to the equivalent emissions of an ICE vehicle with 55 real-world MPG (considerably more in terms of EPA rated MPG). As more regions adopt sustainable energy solutions to generate power, emissions related to charging an EV from the grid will decrease even further.\n",

      "EV customers can accelerate the process of increasing their renewable energy mix by installing solar panels or a Solar Roof and an energy storage solution, such as Powerwall, in their homes. Such an effort dramatically reduces the lifetime carbon footprint of an EV, even when accounting for the carbon footprint of both the solar panel/Solar roof and Powerwall manufacturing. Remaining use-phase emissions from solar charged vehicles come from publicly available fast-charging, which too is becoming “greener” every year. Our goal is to strategically pair solar and battery storage at as many Tesla Supercharger stations as is feasible.\n",

When petroleum is pumped out of the ground, chemically refined, and then burned, it releases harmful emissions into the atmosphere that are not recovered for reuse.

Our ultimate goal is to develop a recycling process that has high recovery rates, low costs, and a low environmental impact. From an economic perspective, we expect to recognize significant savings over the long term, as the costs associated with large-scale battery material recovery and recycling will be far lower than purchasing and transporting new materials to put into cells.\n"

Today, our most efficient Model 3 Standard Range Plus (SR+) achieves an EPA range of 4.8 miles / kWh, more than any EV in production.

It is also reasonable to assume that our high-mileage products, such as our future Tesla Robotaxis, will be designed for maximum energy efficiency as handling, acceleration, and top speed become less relevant. That way, we will minimize cost for our customers as well as reduce the carbon footprint per mile driven.\n",
